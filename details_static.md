{{ site.check }} **Is our Static Web Hosting plan for you?**

**Static Website Generators (Jekyll, Octopress...)<br>
Good old HTML**

This website hosting is perfect for bloggers who adore static website generators like Jekyll, Octopress and similar.

In short, any HTML website with no database connection.

{{ site.check }} **How about Wordpress?**

If you are a mighty geek and run a Wordpress or any other CMS on your localhost, you can _wget_  its static mirror and host it with this plan as well.

Read our [docs](/docs/) if you want to do that or check out our Wordpress hosting plan for a non-geeky, classic Wordpress hosting.
