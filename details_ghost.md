### About Tomato Hunter Ghost Blog Hosting

{{ site.check }} **Is our Ghost Web Hosting plan for you?**

**Self-hosted Ghost Blog<br>
Static Website Generators (Jekyll, Octopress...)<br>
Good old HTML**

Ghost blog hosting is perfect for bloggers who want to run self-hosted Ghost plus maybe a few more static websites or Jekyll blogs.

You will be granted **one database** and full arsenal of **Softaculous one click apps** so if you decide to go for different platform than Ghost, it will be easily done. Just remember that your disk space is limited.


{{ site.check }} **How about Wordpress?**

If you are a mighty geek and run a Wordpress or any other CMS on your localhost, you can _wget_  its static mirror and host it with this plan as well.

Read our [docs](/docs/) if you want to do that or check out our Wordpress hosting plan for a non-geeky, classic Wordpress hosting.

{{ site.check }} **Why static websites?**

If you blog with Jekyll, you need no database, you profit from the best possible website speed and you don't need to worry about security or effects of traffic spikes. There is nothing to generate the _Error estabilishing database connestion_ screen with Jekyll.

> Static web hosting plan will be fine for you if you want to run a few HTML sites or Jekyll blogs. With unlimited domain names and unlimited traffic you get the best bargain to start right up.

More about static websites:

* Static HTML pages are ideal for portfolios or business websites.

* Tomatohunter.com runs on Jekyll.

* Blogs with static website generators are faster.

* No need for caching, no need to worry about Wordpress exploits.

* You can make static mirror of Wordpress or other CMS and host it here.
