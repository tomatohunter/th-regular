WordPress is one of the most popular CMS platforms in the whole world. You can blog on it, you can use it as a portfolio but you can also have an online shop with WordPress.

With our WordPress plan you will be granted unlimited number of databases and full arsenal of *Softaculous one click apps*.

WordPress is not for you? Switching between platforms can be easily done.

You can even run eCommerce platforms with this plan provided you have a reasonable amount of products. ([Contact us](/#contact) for custom plans.)

{{ site.check }} **Wordpress installation?**

Installing WordPress with one click apps takes, well, one click. The installer will set up the database connection for you, install the CMS and send you access data.

[Contact us](/#contact) if you have problems with installation.

{{ site.check }} **How do I move my WordPress blog from somewhere else?**

If you are moving your website from another host, apart from change of nameservers you will also need to move the actual files.

The easiest way to do that is to create a backup with Updraft plus, store it in an external storage and then restore the backup on your new hosting space.
